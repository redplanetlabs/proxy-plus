# proxy-plus

`proxy+` is a replacement for Clojure's `proxy` that's faster and more usable. `proxy` has a strange implementation where it overrides every possible method and uses a mutable field to store a map of string -> function for dispatching the methods. This causes it to be unable to handle methods with the same name but different arities.

`proxy+` fixes these issues with `proxy`. Usage is like `reify`, and it's up to 10x faster.

## Latest version

The latest release version of proxy-plus is hosted on [Clojars](https://clojars.org):

[![Current Version](https://clojars.org/com.rpl/proxy-plus/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.rpl/proxy-plus)

Note that proxy-plus has a dependency on `rama-shaded-asm`, which is hosted on a private Maven repo at `https://nexus.redplanetlabs.com/repository/maven-public-releases`. You'll need to include this repository in your build to resolve the dependencies of proxy-plus. 

## Usage

This library provides the macro `proxy+`. The first argument is fields to provide to the superclass's constructor. Next comes `reify`-like definitions to provide overrides.  When extending a base class, the base class should come first. Example usage:

```clj
(proxy+ [super-arg1 super-arg2]
  BaseClass
  (foo [this] -1)
  (foo [this a b] (+ a b))

  SomeInterface
  (bar [this a b c] (* a b c))

  SomeInterface2
  (bar [this] 100)
  )
```
